### Basic vehicle, friction &amp; movement in p5.js 

Vehicle01 - a single vehicle with a single motor moves across a tile
map, where the tiles are shades of grey representing variable
coefficients of friction. Black (000) is max -ve friction, white (255)
is max (+ve friction). Thus, dark shades to black cause the vehicle to
speed up, light shades to white cause the vehicle to slow down.
